                    <p> <strong>Synopsis:</strong> 
                        In The Crown, the daughter of King George VI (Jared Harris), Elizabeth II (Claire Foy) always knew she would not have an ordinary life. After her father's death in 1952, she took her first steps towards the English throne, starting with weekly audiences with the prime ministers. She takes the crown at just 25 years old, but with great commitments come great responsibilities. The pressure of her duties to the crown takes a toll on her personal life and Elizabeth needs to get her priorities straight in order to fulfill her duties as Queen of England.</p>
