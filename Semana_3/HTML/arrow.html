                    <p> <strong>Synopsis:</strong>
                        Playboy, millionaire and womanizer Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) has been presumably dead for 5
                        years when a yacht accident caused the disappearance of him, his father Robert (Jamey Sheridan),
                        and Sara Lance, sister of his then-girlfriend Laurel ( Katie Cassidy). But Ollie survived and,
                        stranded on an island, he learned to fight for his life. Back in civilization in Starling City,
                        he is a changed man and is determined to honor his father's memory and rid the city of
                        corruption. In disguise, he uses the skills he learned during his time in seclusion to do so,
                        while also having to hide his new identity from his mother, Moira (Susanna Thompson), sister,
                        Thea (Willa Holland) and friends.</p>
